What to make in project:

1. Multi-threading port scanner(asynchronous programming)(threading or asyncio).

2. Specify common ports and scan them and Implement a feature to scan a list of common ports from a file.

3. Implement a feature to scan a range of ports (e.g., 1-1024) or all ports (1-65535).

4. Scan a single IP or a range of IPs and Add a feature to scan a list of IPs from a file

5. After detecting open ports, fetch the service running on them.

6. Estimate the target systemâ€™s OS based on TTL (Time To Live) values.

7. Detect Firewalled or Stealth Ports

8. Allow users to save the scan results to a file (CSV, JSON, or TXT).Provide a color-coded output for better readability (green for open ports, red for closed ports).

9. GUI-Based Port Scanner or If GUI is too much, make it command-line interactive where the user selects options dynamically

10. Create a command-line interface (CLI) with options like:
    -t for target IP
    -p for port range
    -s for subnet scanning
    -h for help
    Use libraries like argparse (Python) to handle command-line arguments.

11. Add real-world use cases like firewall detection, fingerprinting, or logging results

12. Implement a progress bar to show the scan progress

13. Implement diff types of scans like TCP, UDP, or SYN scans

14. Implement a stealth scan using FIN, NULL, or Xmas scans

15. Extend the scanner to create a network map: Identify live hosts in a subnet. Display open ports and services for each host.

16. Integration with APIs: Integrate with APIs like Shodan or VirusTotal to gather additional information about the target IP or domain.

17. Add a stealth mode to slow down the scan and avoid detection by firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS)

18. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure your scanner works on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). Use libraries like socket and subprocess to handle platform-specific differences

19. Error Handling and Logging
